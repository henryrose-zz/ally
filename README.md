# ally


June 12, 2016 a gunman killed 43 and injured 53 others inside of Pulse, a gay night club in Orlando, FL.  To show our solidarity with the LGBT community my wife and I built a large sign for our front yard that reads "ALLY".

This is how the Human Rights Council defines an ally: 

>An “ally” is a term used to describe someone who is supportive of LGBT people. It encompasses non-LGBT allies as well as those within the LGBT community who support each other, e.g. a lesbian who is an ally to the bisexual community. 

The code in this repo runs a website on which people can share photos taken in front of our sign.
